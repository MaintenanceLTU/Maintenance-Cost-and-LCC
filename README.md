# Availability, Maintenance Cost and LCC Analysis  

This repository contains tutorials for implementing **Maintenance Cost and Availability Analysis** in both **MATLAB** and **Python**.  

## Tutorials  

- [MATLAB Tutorial](./MATLAB/Maintenance_Cost_Analysis_MATLAB.md)  
- [Python Tutorial](./Python/Maintenance_Cost_Analysis_Python.md)  

Each tutorial provides a structured implementation of maintenance cost calculations, availability analysis, and NPV (Net Present Value) estimation.  

## Instructions  

1. **MATLAB Users**  
   - Open `Maintenance_Cost_Analysis_MATLAB.md` for step-by-step guidance.  
   - Copy and run the MATLAB code snippets in your workspace.  

2. **Python Users**  
   - Open `Maintenance_Cost_Analysis_Python.md` for step-by-step guidance.  
   - Run the provided Python scripts in **Jupyter Notebook** or a **Python IDE** (e.g., Spyder, VS Code, PyCharm).  

## Additional Notes  

- Python users need **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** for calculations and plotting.
